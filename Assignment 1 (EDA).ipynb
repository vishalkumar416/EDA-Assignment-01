    "### **Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wine Quality dataset typically contains the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Acidity** – Determines non-volatile acids (e.g., tartaric acid). High values may lead to a sour taste.\n",
    "2. **Volatile Acidity** – Acetic acid content; higher levels lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.\n",
    "3. **Citric Acid** – Adds freshness and flavor; low values make wine taste flat.\n",
    "4. **Residual Sugar** – Determines sweetness; too much sugar may make the wine taste syrupy.\n",
    "5. **Chlorides** – Salt concentration; high chloride content can negatively affect taste.\n",
    "6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)** – Acts as an antioxidant; protects wine from microbial spoilage.\n",
    "7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)** – Excessive amounts may give a pungent smell.\n",
    "8. **Density** – Related to sugar and alcohol content; useful in distinguishing wine quality.\n",
    "9. **pH** – Indicates acidity level; impacts taste and microbial stability.\n",
    "10. **Sulphates** – Contribute to wine’s antioxidant property; enhance wine preservation.\n",
    "11. **Alcohol** – Strongly correlated with wine quality; higher alcohol often indicates better fermentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:** Alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, and citric acid are often the strongest predictors of wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality data set during the feature engineering process? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques for handling missing data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deletion (Dropping rows/columns)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Advantage: Simple and fast.\n",
    "   * Disadvantage: Can lead to information loss if many values are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Advantage: Preserves dataset size.\n",
    "   * Disadvantage: May reduce variability and distort distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Advantage: Uses feature similarity; captures local patterns.\n",
    "   * Disadvantage: Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regression Imputation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Advantage: Predicts missing values using other correlated features.\n",
    "   * Disadvantage: May introduce bias if assumptions are violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiple Imputation (MICE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Advantage: Maintains variability by creating multiple estimates.\n",
    "   * Disadvantage: Complex and computationally heavy.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Q3. What are the key factors that affect students' performance in exams? How would you go about analyzing these factors using statistical techniques?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Factors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demographics:** Age, gender, parental education, family income.\n",
    "* **Study habits:** Hours of study, attendance, participation.\n",
    "* **Psychological:** Motivation, stress, mental health.\n",
    "* **Environmental:** School support, teacher quality, peer influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis** – To see which factors strongly correlate with scores.\n",
    "2. **Regression Analysis** – To predict performance based on multiple factors.\n",
    "3. **ANOVA / t-tests** – To compare groups (e.g., male vs. female, high vs. low parental education).\n",
    "4. **Chi-square tests** – For categorical variables (e.g., study time categories vs. grades).\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning Models (Decision Trees, Random Forests)** – To find key predictors of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance data set. How did you select and transform the variables for your model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Chose features like study time, absences, parental education, internet access, family support, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transformation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Converted categorical variables (e.g., \"yes/no\", \"male/female\") into numeric using **one-hot encoding**.\n",
    "   * Standardized numeric features (e.g., exam scores, study hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Combined midterm and final exam into a \"total score\".\n",
    "   * Created binary labels: **Pass/Fail**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Q5. Load the wine quality data set and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the distribution of each feature. Which feature(s) exhibit non-normality, and what transformations could be applied to these features to improve normality?**\n",
